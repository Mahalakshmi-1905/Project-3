    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>2004 Tsunami[edit] <br>
        See also: 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami <br>
        Velankanni town was among the worst hit by the massive 26 December tsunami that was triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The tsunami struck at around 9.30 am on that Sunday, when pilgrims from Kerala were inside the church attending the Malayalam Mass. The rising water level did not enter the shrine, but the receding waters swept away hundreds of pilgrims who were on the beach.[2]
        
        The shrine's compound, nearby villages, hundreds of shops, homes and pilgrims were washed away into the sea. About 600 pilgrims died.[3] Rescue teams extricated more than 400 bodies from the sand and rocks in the vicinity and large number of unidentified bodies were buried in mass graves.</p>
