    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The combined height of the statue and pedestal is 133 feet (41 metres), denoting the 133 chapters of the Thirukkural. This includes a 95-foot (29-metre) sculpture of Valluvar standing upon a 38-foot (12-metre) pedestal that represents the 38 chapters of Virtue, the first of the three books of the Kural text. The statue itself represents the second and third books of the Kural text, namely, Wealth and Love. The whole design signifies that wealth and love be earned and enjoyed on the foundation of solid virtue.[3] The right hand of the statue with three fingers pointing skywards signifies the three cantos of the Kural text, namely, Aram, Porul, and Inbam (Virtue, Wealth, and Love, respectively), combined.[4] The head of the statue stands at a height of 61 metres (200 ft) above the sea level.[5]

        The statue, with its slight bend around the waist is reminiscent[citation needed] of a dancing pose of the Hindu deities like Nataraja. The statue weighs 7,000 tonnes (6,900 long tons; 7,700 short tons).[6]

        The monument is regarded as a cultural fusion because of its juxtaposition beside the Vivekananda Rock Memorial. Built-in conformation with traditional Indian architecture, the statue has provision to provide a hollow portion inside from toe to scalp. Visitors, however, will not be allowed to scale, but instead be permitted to climb up to the foot of the statue at a height of 12 metres (38 ft).[4]</p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>The project was conceived by then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in December 1975.[4] On 15 April 1979, the then Prime Minister Morarji Desai laid the foundation stone for the statue, in the presence of the then Chief Minister, M. G. Ramachandran.[4] However, the actual sculpting work, led by Dr. V. Ganapati Sthapathy, former principal of the Government College of Architecture at Mahabalipuram,[5] began a decade later on 6 September 1990, on the tiny island adjacent to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial when funds were allocated in the 1990–91 budget.[4]

        Sthapathy was chosen for the project over 300 master builders because his suggestion for an all-stone monument to the poet-philosopher prevailed. He observed that stone would be more durable than metal, citing that the Statue of Liberty, which is made of copper, required extensive renovation just a century after its installation. Initially, the project stalled, perhaps owing to Karunanidhi's election loss, but then recommenced in 1997 when he returned to office.[5] At the cost of more than ₹61.4 million (equivalent to ₹260 million or US$3.1 million in 2023), the project employed about 150 workers, sculptors, assistants and supervisors, who worked about 16 hours a day to complete the work.</p>

     <h2>Maintenance</h2>
     <p>To prevent the statue from corrosion due to sea breeze, the statue is chemically treated once in four years. The salty deposits in every joint are removed and replaced with new cement mixture. Paper pulp is then applied on the whole of the statue. As the paper pulp coating dries, it absorbs the salty deposits completely, after which it is removed.[7]

        The statue has been thus treated three times since its unveiling. The fourth treatment began on 17 April 2017 and was completed by 15 October 2017</p>
